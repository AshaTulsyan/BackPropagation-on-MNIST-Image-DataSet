# BackPropagation-on-MNIST-Image-DataSet
This Repository contains the entire Python Code for Training on MNIST image dataset ,using Bcakpropagation.I am going to classify the MNIST
dataset using multi-layer neural networks with softmax outputs.
After that i also experimented with Adding a momentum term, shuffling data, Batch Gradient Descnet to improve the accuarcy on the Validation or Hold-out Set.
